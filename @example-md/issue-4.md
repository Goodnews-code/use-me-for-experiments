#### Issue description
Our app has expanded and there are now 2 more apps that need different `favicon.ico` images to show up in the browser tab.

#

#### Steps to reproduce the issue
1. Go to https://github.com/code-collabo/collabo-community-app, and run the app locally
2. Navigate to `/` or `/community`  routes
3. Navigate to `/code-collabo` routes
4. Navigate to `/other-subcommunity` routes
5. Observe the browser tab as you navigate. See that only code-collabo routes have favicon show up in the browser tab.

#

#### Additional context
You can request for the favicon images from @Geefundesign and @Ifycode in the discord community channel.
